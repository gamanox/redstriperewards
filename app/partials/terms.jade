Individuals can also accumulate STRIPES via special STRIPES giveaways, at the Sponsor’s discretion.

				p 2.  Family of Red Stripe Excluded Persons  (spouse, parents, siblings, and children) and persons residing with Red Stripe Excluded Persons  may participate under the condition that the total number of STRIPES that each such family member/person can redeem in the current Promotional Period is capped at 2,000.

If Member does not provide a Jamaican Government-issued ID when required, or if his or her cellular phone number or email address is deemed to be invalid, Sponsor reserves the right to withhold redemption of the reward, to invalidate the entry or play, and/or to lock Member's Account, in its sole discretion.
				p F. Entering Codes and Collecting STRIPES
				p 1.  Collect STRIPES at any time during the Promotional Period, by entering codes from Participating Brand Packaging, listed on the Website and updated from time to time. Codes may also be obtained through other methods as offered from time to time, including but not limited to, scratch cards, print pieces, check-out coupons, or various social media promotions.

				p a.  Text Messaging: Using a Device, send a text message with your code to   +1-876-444-7744. If you have linked the phone number of your Device in your Account enrolment profile, the STRIPES will be consolidated in your Account. If you credit your Account via text messaging you will be charged $4 per message.  There will be no charge for text messages received by you. When you enter codes via text messaging, you will receive text messages in response to each code entry, unless otherwise specified in the specific promotion. Text messaging may not be available through all wireless carriers.
				p b.  Website/Branded Site: Visit the Website or Facebook Interface during the Promotional Period and follow the links and instructions to either register or Sign In and enter codes.
				p c.  Red Stripe Rewards Mobile App: Using a smartphone running Android or iOS operating system, download the Red Stripe Rewards App from either Google Play or the Apple Store. Once installed, locate the icon to enter codes and follow the links and instructions to do so.
				p 3.  If you are a Member, your Account will be credited with the STRIPES you have collected. Some methods may not be available during the entire Promotional Period. Sponsor reserves the right to change, add, or remove the methods by which you can collect STRIPES.
			
				p 4.  Sponsor reserves the right to change the number of STRIPES awarded at any time during the Program. STRIPES collected through other methods including but not limited to, scratch cards, codes in print, codes on check-out coupons, or via social media promotions may vary in value. Bonus STRIPES are defined as (a) STRIPES collected by means other than entering codes from Participating Brand Packaging, such as STRIPES awarded as prizes, and/or (b) STRIPES collected from codes on Participating Brand Packaging that vary from the amounts listed on the Website, as the amounts may be amended from time to time.
				p 5.  Most Codes can only be used 1 time for the Program. However, there will be codes that can be used by multiple users and/or multiple times per user. Limit: Members may accrue no more than 1,000 STRIPES per week for valid codes from Participating Brand Packaging (except for Bonus STRIPES, which have a separate limit of 500 STRIPES per Member, per week). For purposes of this limit, a week is defined as beginningat 12:00 a.m. p each Monday and ending at 11:59 p.m. the following Sunday. Bonus STRIPES are not included in the STRIPES per week limit. If a Member were to enter 20 invalid codes on a given day, the Member would be unable to enter any more codes for a period of 24 hours. Regardless of method of accruing STRIPES, including prizes, a Member may accrue no more than 5,000 STRIPES per week.
			.section-third.Column2

				p 6.  Members may be invited to submit the names, phone number and 
				p email addresses of friends who are eligible to enrol in the Program. Each person referred by a Member will receive an email, Facebook or Twitter notification solely notifying him or her about the Program. The email, Facebook or Twitter notification will be sent directly from the Member to the friend and Sponsor will not collect additional information about the friend unless the friend later enrols in the Program and provides the information. Members may only refer persons with whom they have an existing relationship. For each referred person who enrols in the Program within 14 days of the referral, the referring Member will receive 5 STRIPES (up to a maximum of 200 STRIPES per month for referrals) which will be deposited in his/her Account. An email, Facebook or Twitter notification will not be sent to the referred friend if he or she is already enrolled in the Program, or has previously opted out of receiving emails from Sponsor, in which case the referral is not valid for purposes of this section and the referring Member will not receive any referral STRIPES.
				p 7.  It is a violation of the Program for anyone to purchase or otherwise acquire codes from third parties, to combine codes obtained by others for deposit into a single Account, and/or to transfer or sell codes under any circumstance, other than in programs authorized by Sponsor. Furthermore, corporations, associations or other groups may not participate in the Program. It is fraudulent for any individual or company, association, or group to direct, encourage, or allow individuals to use a single Account for the purpose of accumulating STRIPES for combined use. Any attempt to combine or transfer codes or STRIPES will result in Member’s disqualification from the Program and forfeiture of all STRIPES in the Member’s Account. Sponsor reserves the right to take any action it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, in the event that it believes (in its sole discretion) that any Member has violated any of these provisions.
				p 8.  Codes are void if (a) not obtained in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and through legitimate channels; (b) any part of the code or the packaging or promotional item on which it is printed is counterfeit, altered, defective, tampered with, or irregular in any way; or (c) obtained as the result of a sale or transfer which Sponsor, in its sole discretion, determines is in violation of these Terms and Conditions and the objectives of the Program. 
				p 9.  If a Member believes that STRIPES were not properly accrued to his/her Account, the Member must notify Sponsor by using one of the communication options in the Contact Us page found at, www.redstriperewards.com/contact , within 15 days of the date the code was entered on the Website or via texting via Device.
				p 10.  Each Member must save the bottle cap, product packaging, and/or promotional item with official code for at least 90 days after the date Member enters the code on the Website, as it may be necessary to submit it later for verification.  Sponsor further reserves the right to request proof that the code was obtained by Member in compliance with these Terms and Conditions. In its sole discretion, Sponsor reserves the right to reverse STRIPES previously credited to a Member’s Account, if, upon Sponsor’s request, a code or codes cannot be properly verified, or if it is determined that the code or codes were not obtained in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and through legitimate channels. Sponsor’s decisions regarding the awarding and/or reversing of STRIPES are final and binding.

Each Member must comply with any individual Rewards limitations indicated on the Website/Facebook Interface. The items listed in the Prizes will fluctuate throughout the Promotional Period as available items are redeemed and additional items are added by Sponsor.

				p 1  If a Member’s Account has remained inactive for a period of 90 days or more, the Member will forfeit any STRIPES remaining in the Account, without compensation.

Sponsor reserves the right to terminate or temporarily suspend the Program at any time, for any reason, with notice, even though termination may affect a Member’s ability to accrue or use his/her STRIPES. In the event of an early termination, Members will have 5 days from the date Program termination is announced to redeem their STRIPES. If the Program expires as scheduled, Members will have until the end of the Promotional Period to redeem their STRIPES.
